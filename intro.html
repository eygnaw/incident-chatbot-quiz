  <h1>Incident-Decision Quiz</h1>

  <p>
    To assess the effectiveness of the conversational AI system in managing incidents dynamically and accommodating user preferences, a quiz was created with 15 simulated scenarios. \n
    We are going to evaluate the response time (time took to answer the quiz), error rate (picking the wrong action to take), and user satisfaction (based on the feedback rating and user comments).\n
    This first version of the quiz has only 15 questions and the guideline pdf attached. Comments are welcomed for improvements before the final version of our evaluation system.\n
    We will afterwards split the quiz into chatbot only version and a guideline only version for a direct comparasion between the two, while also having a larger pool of scenarios.
